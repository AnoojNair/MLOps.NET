MLOps.NET is an data science tool to track and manage the lifecycle of an [ML.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning) machine learning model.

- Experiment tracking (SQLite, SQLServer, CosmosDb)
  - Experiments
  - Runs
  - Training time
  - Evaluation metrics
  - Hyper parameters
- Data tracking
  - Data schema
  - Data quantity
  - Data hash
  - Data distribution (in progress)
- Model repostiory (Azure, AWS, local fileshare)
  - Run artifacts
  - Versioned registered models
- Model deployment
  - URI based deployment (in progress)
  - Containerized deployment (in roadmap)
  - Manual deployment (in roadmap)
  
A client application to vizualize and manage the ML lifecycle is currently in the [roadmap](https://github.com/aslotte/MLOps.NET/blob/master/images/roadmap.png) to be worked on.

### Tell me more
If you're used to creating machine learning models in libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, Scikitlearn or H2O you may have come across libraries such as MLflow or Neptune to manage and track the life-cycle of your machine learning models. 

Models created in ML.NET can however currently not be used in MLflow, and as such the idea of MLOps.NET was spawn.
