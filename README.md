### What is MLOps.NET?
If you're used to creating machine learning models in libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, Scikitlearn or H2O you may have come across libraries such as MLflow or Neptune to manage and track the life-cycle of your machine learning models. 

Models created in ML.NET can however currently not be used in MLflow, and as such the idea of MLOps.NET was spawn.

### Roadmap
The project is intended to support:
- Track model metrics and artifacts from experiments and runs
- Ability to store metrics and models both on-premise and in the cloud
